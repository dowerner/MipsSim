# MipsSim
A small simulator of a MIPS 32 Processor for Windows.

## Introduction
MipsSim is meant as an easy to use tool to write short MIPS 32 programs in the MIPS assembler language and be able to execute them on a simulated CPU. The program executes the program line by line allowing the user to see exactly what happens in the CPU register banks as well as what happens in the accessed parts of the main memory.

## Functionality
* Code Editor
* Executing programs written in the MIPS assembler language
* Read and edit Registers and Memory at runtime
* Save/Load Memory content to a file at runtime
* Save/Load Register content to a file at runtim
* Configure size of the main memory of the simulated computer
