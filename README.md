# MipsSim
A small simulator of a MIPS 32 Processor for Windows.

## Introduction
MipsSim is meant as an easy to use tool to write short MIPS 32 programs in the MIPS assembler language and be able to execute them on a simulated CPU. The program executes the program line by line allowing the user to see exactly what happens in the CPU register banks as well as what happens in the accessed parts of the main memory.

## Functionality
* Code Editor for writing saving and loading programs
* Executing programs written in the MIPS assembler language
* Read and edit Registers and Memory at runtime
* Save/Load Memory content to a file at runtime
* Save/Load Register content to a file at runtim
* Configure size of the main memory of the simulated computer

## User Interface
The user interface in MipsSim consits of the following components.

### Menu Bar
On the top left of the menu bar the file menu can be found. The file menu allows saving, loading and opening code files. The file menu also allows the user to save the current content of the main memory of the virtual computer to a file as well as the content of the registers. Both of those file types can then be loaded back into the program.
